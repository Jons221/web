            Python undoubtedly tops the list. It is widely accepted as the best programming language to learn first.
            Python is fast, easy-to-use,
            and easy-to-deploy programming language that is being widely used to develop scalable web applications.
            YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, SurveyMonkey are all built-in Python. Python provides excellent library
            support and has a large developer community.
            The programming language provides a great starting point for beginners.
            You might find Python useful for back-end services and API’s, if you’re in security or Site Reliability
            Engineering. Python-based web development framework like Django, Pyramid and Turbo Gear have found more and
            more popularity.

          If anybody asks why java, most frequent sentence comes up would be “write once, run everywhere” – Java has
          been the ruling programming language for the last 20 years. Java is 99% object-oriented and is robust as java
          objects contain no references to data external to themselves. It is simpler than C++ because Java uses
          automatic memory allocation and garbage collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java is highly cross-platform compatible or platform independent. Since you can code anywhere (I mean on all
          devices), compile into low-level machine code, and finally, execute on any platform using JVM – Java Virtual
          Machine (which is platform dependent).
        </p>
        <p>
          Java forms the base for the Android operating system and opted around 90% fortune 500 companies for making a
          variety of back-end applications. I would not hesitate for taking the biggest sensation Apache Hadoop data
          processing, run by Amazon Web Services and Windows Azure.
        </p>
        <p>
          With so many good reasons and a wide range of business applications, possessing immense flexibility and java
          is all time beginners’ favorite.

          Being introduced in the late 1970s, C has made a strong contribution to the world of programming.
          C has been the parent language of a handful; some are either derived from C or inspired by its syntax,
          constructs, and paradigms, including Java, Objective-C, and C#.
        </p>
        <p>
          C/C++ is like the bread and butter of programming. Almost all low-level systems such as operating systems,
          file systems, etc are written in C/C++. If you wish to be a system-level programmer, C/C++ is the language you
          should learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linux OS is C based. And CPP is the hybrid version of C. C++ is an object-oriented programming language and
          which is built on C; therefore it is preferred over others for designing higher-level applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          C++ is seeing as more performing than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked before it
          is executed on real grounds. Core areas of developments are Virtual Reality, gaming, computer graphics etc.

          JavaScript is the “frontend” programming language. JavaScript is widely used to design interactive frontend
          applications. For instance, when you click on a button which opens up a popup, the logic is implemented via
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primarily, JavaScript is light weighed, interpreted and plays a major role in front-end development. Even some
          of the major social media platforms believe that JavaScript provides an easy way to create interactive web
          pages smoothly and is career-driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, many organizations, particularly startups, are using NodeJS which is a JavaScript-based run-time
          environment. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to
          produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. Hence now with JS, you can
          use a single programming language for server-side and client-side scripts.

          PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a general-purpose programming language. Clearly, PHP is a scripting
          language, which runs on a server, and it is used to create web pages written in HTML. It is popular because it
          is free, cheap, easy to set up and simple to use for new programmers.

          PHP is a very strong option for web developers around the globe. It is widely used to create dynamic web page
          content, and images used on websites. It’s hitting on number #5 because of its broad range of usage. Also, PHP
          is well dressed for WordPress CMS (Content Management System).

          C-sharp is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000. C-sharp is utilized in developing desktop applications and more recently, Windows 8/10 applications and requires a .NET framework to function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft developed C# as a rival to Java. Actually, Sun did not want the interference of Microsoft to make changes in Java. So, it was created.
        </p>
        <p>
          C# has a variety of features which makes it easier to learn for the beginners. The code is consistent, and logical as compared to C++.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spotting errors in C# are easy as it is statically typed language, where the code is checked before turning it to an application.
          In short, it is perfect to develop web applications, desktop application and also proved itself in VR, 2D, and 3D gaming. Cross-platform tools like Xamarin have written in C# makes it all devices compatible.
