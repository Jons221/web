        <!-- <h2>what Programming Language Should I Learn First?</h2> -->
        <br />
        <div>
            Many people want to get started – but don’t know what language to learn first.
            With so many languages out there, it can be a bit overwhelming for beginners.
            so now we suggest you start from Html and now you ask why we should start from Html.
        </div>
        <br />
        <h4><strong>Why HTML should be the first language you learn?</strong></h4>
        <p>
            many people chose a more difficult programming language as their first, such as C++ or Java and they lost
            interest in it quickly.
            HTML is easy to type and can generate beautiful results, and it is often taught in computer lessons in
            schools for that reason.
            Although HTML can get more difficult as you get into more complex ideas, it’s fairly easy to start with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason to learn HTML is the relative ease of learning and typing it.
            Html coders rarely get stuck for a long time.
            You can find help at websites such as W3schools or question and answers sites such as Stack Overflow.
            Obviously, the website that you are now on – Codementor.io is also a great way to connect to experts to
            solve your problem.
            There are many great tools and code editors for HTML. Some of the best include Visual Studio Code,Sublime,
            Notepad++, and more.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>If you make one website you can learn more than 1 Programming language to make responsive website like</p> -->
        <h3><strong>Other Languages</strong></h3>
        <p>However, there are some things HTML and CSS cannot do. As a result, you often have to learn some other
            languages – let me explain them to you here.
            For example, many websites have beautiful sliders in their homepage.
            The best way to make them is out of Javascript and jQuery – although you could make them out of only HTML
            and CSS</p>
        <p>
            All of the popular websites on the web nowadays, including Google, Yahoo, Youtube, Facebook, and Wikipedia
            use JavaScript in their front-end (although there aren’t many choices anyways).
            You can achieve spectacular effects with JavaScript too, as shown here. Another example would be a contact
            form or an eCommerce system – that, on the other hand, must be made through PHP.
            Facebook, WordPress, and Digg uses PHP as their backend, as PHP allows you to easily work with databases.
            Of course, there are others you could create a contact form or an eCommerce system, although PHP is one of
            the more commonly used.
